# Requirements & Design Specification Academic LaTeX Transformation Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for transforming the existing RDS_Document.docx into a publication-ready academic LaTeX document following university-level research paper standards for the HIV Clinic Appointment Booking System.

## Analysis of Current RDS Document

### Current Structure
The existing RDS document contains:
- **Title**: Global Access Management System (GAMS) - *Needs updating to HIV Clinic*
- **4 Main Sections**: Overview, Requirement Specifications, Design Specifications, Appendix
- **Content Coverage**: ~70% filled with substantial use case examples
- **Key Components**: 
  - Actor definitions and use case diagrams
  - Screen flow descriptions and authorization matrices
  - Database schema methodology
  - Business rules framework
  - Functional requirement templates

### Content Gaps Identified
1. **System Context**: Document references a cafeteria system instead of HIV clinic
2. **Actors**: Generic roles need specialization for healthcare context
3. **Use Cases**: Need alignment with actual clinic appointment booking system
4. **Database Design**: Needs integration with actual schema from `schema.sql`
5. **Academic Rigor**: Lacks literature review, methodology citations, and formal analysis

## Transformation Strategy

### Phase 1: Content Extraction and Contextualization
1. **Preserve Methodological Framework**
   - Keep the use case template structure
   - Maintain business rules categorization
   - Retain authorization matrix approach
   - Preserve functional description methodology

2. **Contextualize for HIV Clinic System**
   - Replace GAMS with HIV Clinic Appointment Booking System
   - Update actors to reflect healthcare roles (Patient, Doctor, Admin, Manager)
   - Align use cases with actual system functionality
   - Integrate real database schema from `schema.sql`

### Phase 2: Academic Enhancement
1. **Literature Review Integration**
   - Requirements Engineering methodologies (IEEE 830, Sommerville)
   - Healthcare Information Systems standards (HL7, FHIR)
   - Software Engineering best practices (Pressman, Larman)
   - Database design principles (Codd, Date)

2. **Formal Analysis Methods**
   - Traceability matrices
   - Requirements validation metrics
   - Design pattern documentation
