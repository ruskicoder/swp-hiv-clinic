# RDS Document Rewrite - Completion Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive rewrite of the LaTeX Requirements Design Specification (RDS) document (`RDS_Document_HIV_Clinic_Filled.tex`) to align with the definitive use case evaluation from `HIV_Clinic_Use_Cases.md`.

## Pre-check Results ✅

### 1. Diagram Integrity Verification
- **Source Files**: 17 diagram source files (.mermaid and .plantuml)
- **Compiled SVG Files**: 17 corresponding SVG files confirmed to exist
- **Referenced Diagrams**: All diagrams referenced in the RDS document exist and are properly linked
- **Key Diagrams Verified**:
  - ✅ `diagrams/use_case_diagram.svg` (46,863 bytes)
  - ✅ `diagrams/user_interface_flow.svg` (113,282 bytes)

### 2. Use Case Diagram Consistency ✅
- The existing use case diagram (`use_case_diagram.plantuml`) is **perfectly aligned** with the 27 use cases from the evaluation
- Diagram follows proper UML standards:
  - ✅ Only 'Unauthenticated User' and authenticated users (Patient, Doctor, Admin, Manager) as actors
  - ✅ All actors properly positioned around system boundary
  - ✅ All 27 use cases placed inside system boundary
  - ✅ Correct Association, Generalization, Include, and Extend relationships modeled

## Major Changes Implemented ✅

### 1. Use Case Alignment
**Before**: 41 use cases (UC-001 to UC-041) that didn't match the evaluation
**After**: Exactly 27 use cases (UC-001 to UC-027) from the definitive evaluation

### 2. Actor Model Updates
- **Updated Actor Descriptions**: Clarified the inheritance model where all authenticated users inherit base capabilities
